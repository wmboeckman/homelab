# Homelab NAS Project - Planning

As my current Homelab consists of only compute so far, I have been thinking about building out some networked storage. One of the two main reasons behind this new requirement is due to the lack of secondary storage for each of my nodes, meaning that my cluster isn't actually High-Availability yet!

### Requirements

I have two constraints I need to follow: The NAS must be power-efficient (<50 Watts) and Affordable (less than $200 total). Ideally, I would also like my NAS solution to be compact, taking up no more space than what my current Proxmox cluster does. The NAS must also support a protocol that Proxmox can use for High-Availability, such as iSCSI.

After some initial research, these constraints rule out any off-the-shelf retail product, leaving the used market and/or a custom build.

Right now, my plan is to search places like eBay for used compact computers and NAS products for good opportunities.
