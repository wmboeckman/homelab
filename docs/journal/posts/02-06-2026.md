# Fresh New Layout!

Part of a Professional Development activity I am taking on this month is to reformat all of my homelab documentation to to be more formal. Additionally, I plan on adopting a suitable Project Management framework to help prioritize any new features or changes in the future. 

### New formatting

I decided it was worth the effort to convert my markdown documentation over to something more professional and *much* easier to navigate: `MkDocs`!
