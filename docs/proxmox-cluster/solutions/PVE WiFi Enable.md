### Enabling WiFi on Proxmox VE 9.1.1
I followed a guide made by [Ikhlash Rakhmanta](https://github.com/ikhlashr-workspace/Proxmox-HomeLab/blob/main/1%20Networking%20-%20Additional%20Wifi%20Configuration.md) to enable the wireless network on each of my servers. While this worked well for the Hypervisor host, the system was not yet configured to provide routing between this interface and any VMs or Containers.
