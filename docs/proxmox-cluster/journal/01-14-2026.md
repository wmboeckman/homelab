A have good news: The network seems to be stable! While Proxmox's SDN still seems to have that bug (DHCP server leases IPs even to statically-assigned guests), so long as I update the IP in the 'IPAM' settings everything continues to work.

While I had more important things to work on (firewall, tailnet ACLs, etc) I decided to test out a split-horizon local DNS within my tailscale network:

## My DNS Solution

This mostly started out of curiosity when I discovered the split-horizon DNS setting under my tailnet's configuration dashboard. I wanted to quickly set up a locally-controlled (not public yet) domain name to assign aliases to the various services I plan on running. I wanted both a DNS server for the actual domain resolution and a reverse proxy for managing the various http/s services / backends I want to access.

For this, I chose Technitium for my DNS solution and Zoraxy for my reverse proxy. Each have an easy to use web dashboard and premade LXC install scripts.
