I am currently implementing a private internal subnet that will get connected to the wireless interface via NAT by following parts of [this guide](https://blog.popescul.com/posts/2025/07/20/proxmox-bridge-dhcp-setup/). However, I am currently running into issues with getting the internal DHCP server up and running, could be something to do with it starting up before the other interfaces have time to catch up, might try to add some artificial wait time for the service on startup? My plan is to experiment and break things up until Thanksgiving, where I will have a bit of free time to re-provision everything and come up with a better plan.
