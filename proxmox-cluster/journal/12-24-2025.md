Now that finals is over, I've had a bit of time to work on my lab cluster again!

---

### My goals for winter break are as follows: 
- **Secure the Software / OS**
  - Create non-root admin accounts w/ sudo access
  - Find a proxmox hardening guide somewhere?
  
- **Secure the Network**
  - Enable firewall (enable web portal and ssh only over the wired interface?)
  - Install fail2ban (web portal and ssh) to block bot traffic, low-effort attacks
  - Find a network traffic monitoring tool?

- **Deploy a few test services** (various VMs, Containers)
  - Ensure network connectivity for instances!

- **Depoy a HA conatiner for 'cloudflard' network tunnel**
  - For now, this seems to be a secure way to access the network from the outside. I would like to use a reverse proxy in the future but will require further research.

## Happy Holidays!
