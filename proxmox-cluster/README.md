## 3-Node Proxmox Cluster
---
### Project Overview
My goal for this project is to build a Cluster of *Proxmox Hypervisors* that will allow me to run future projects on top of. This project will allow me to get my hands dirty with *virtualization* and apply some of my *Computer Networking* knowledge to set up a secure network topology that will allow me to "safely" host a variety of services to the public internet. For now, however, my plan is to only expose these services via a *Cloudflare Tunnel*.
